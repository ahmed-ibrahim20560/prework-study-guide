# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made the Prework Study Guide as a boot camp student for a warm-up (and later as a guide) to prepare for future projects involving: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

No installation is needed.

## Usage

To benefit from the Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For prompts on what to study initially, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learnt from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
